## Usage

Add the following parser to your endpoint.ex file.

```elixir
plug Plug.Parsers,
  parsers: [:urlencoded, :multipart, :json],
  pass: ["*/*"],
  json_decoder: Poison

plug Appsignal.JSPlug # Above your app's router plug
plug MyExampleApp.Router
```

Now send the errors with a POST request to the `/appsignal_error_catcher`
endpoint. An example JavaScript is provided on the AppSignal docs website in
the [Front-end error handling] section.

For more information see the AppSignal [Front-end error handling] Beta docs.

## Installation

Make sure to install the [AppSignal for Elixir] package first by following the
[installation guide].

After having successfully installed AppSignal add `appsignal_js_plug` to your
list of dependencies in `mix.exs`.

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [
    {:appsignal, ">= 1.3.0"},
    {:appsignal_js_plug, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then run `mix deps.get`.

## Configuration

This package listens to the AppSignal for Elixir [`skip_session_data`
configuration option]. If this option is set to `true`, no session data will be
added to the JavaScript errors.

```elixir
# config/appsignal.exs
config :appsignal, :config, skip_session_data: true
```

## Development

### Testing

Package testing is done with ExUnit and can be run with the `mix test` command.
You can also supply a path to a specific file path you want to test and even a
specific line on which the test you want to run is defined.

```sh
mix deps.get
mix test
mix test test/appsignal/some_test.ex:123
```
